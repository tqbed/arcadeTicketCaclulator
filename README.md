# arcadeTicketCaclulator
Tells you how much each Hack Club Arcade prize would be valued for, and can reccomend you the most "worth it" prize based on your ticket number. All dollar values are in CAD, and prices may be very wrong. For some I did my best guess as I couldn't find exact value (e.g unknown soldering iron model, factory second frameworks), and some are based on specs given in Slack but still may be wrong. 

This is just for fun as I am not a great coder, very rusty, and needed a project idea that wouldn't be too complex, and I thought calculating value per ticket for the shop items would be interesting. These values may be very wrong and I reccomend not thinking about the value, just pick the items that are coolest to you!
